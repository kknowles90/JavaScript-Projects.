 ## intro 
  
  My name is Kyle Knowles. I have been practicing coding since 2019. I am just getting into the more advanced stages of coding.
  I am attempting to start my own career within software development soon, in which I hope to expand my collection of github projects. In the meantime, please enjoy the few projects I have. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
  
  ## TheSpaceResort
  (https://github.com/kknowles90/HTML-and-CSS-Projects./tree/main/project)
  The Space Resort was my first HTML/CSS project attempt. I had some minor issues but overall it turned out great. 
  
  ## Academy
  (https://github.com/kknowles90/HTML-and-CSS-Projects./tree/main/bootstrap4_project)
  Academy Cinemas was my first attempt to start inplimenting bootsrap which enabled me to focus more on styling and adding design, rather than the code itself.
  
  ## Pizza
  (https://github.com/kknowles90/JavaScript-Projects./tree/main/Pizza_Project)
  This is was one of my early attempts to fully understand JS and the conole systems. In it you will notice that everything is functional as far as the receipt and total.
  The purpose of this site was simply to get a better understanding of how to use javascript to get inputs and display them correctly back to the user.
  
  ## TicTacToe
  (https://github.com/kknowles90/JavaScript-Projects./tree/main/TicTacToe)
  TicTacToe was one of my early stages of JavaScript as well. In it there was be animations and sound effects. The purpose of this project was to get a firm grasp of structure
  and arrays. My main focus was to get an input, allow my JavaScript to use that input and put it into an array, and then allow the end result to notice if the win condition
  is fullfilled.
  
  ## calc
  The calculator is functional and allows a wide range of options. The purpose of this project was to understand order of operations and how to pass multiple variables through
  multiple functions. As well as, to transfer false or true positions into multiple scenarios and come out with a nominal outcome.
